COVID-19 Tracker using ReactJS

In this project, I have created a COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Application. I have used React with the addition of Charts.js, Material UI, and many different modules. Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. So, to make the situation better, I came up with an idea to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and I have created cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. The project fetches the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax.

The features of the website are easy to use, attractive UI, charts speak more than text, real-time data, and last but not least, it is a responsive website for both desktop & mobile view.
